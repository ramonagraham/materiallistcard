    <string name="item_desc">The Dahlia Trial Garden in Tacoma is one of the largest
        official trial gardens in the U.S. and Canada.
    </string>
    <string name="detail_desc">the Dahlia Trial Garden is maintained
        in cooperation with the Washington Dahlia Society.
        The garden is comprised of plants grown from tubers sent by
        dahlia growers from throughout America, Canada, England,
        New Zealand and Australia. Each year, the dahlias are scored by
        official judges of the American Dahlia Society.
        Dahlias receiving between 85 and 100 points are included in the
        annual classification book. They are then named and become
        available to the general public. Blooms begin in July, but
        August is the best time to view the garden in full bloom, when
        plants reach heights higher than 6 feet.
